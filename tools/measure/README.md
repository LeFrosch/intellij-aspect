# `measure` - aspect analysis benchmark tool

Measures the cost of running the IntelliJ aspect over a Bazel project. It deploys the current
aspect into the project, then measures a baseline build and an aspect-enabled build repeatedly,
recording heap and GC statistics so the aspect's overhead can be read directly from the delta.

## What it measures

The tool measures against a fresh output base in a temporary directory, keeping the project's
own server and build outputs separate. Repository downloads can use a shared persistent cache.
It first pre-warms that output base with
`bazel build --nobuild <target>`, so the measured builds do not pay the fetch cost. All runs then share that
output base, but the server is shut down before every build, so each repeat measures a cold
analysis instead of an incremental re-analysis of the repeat before it - which is what makes the
repeats comparable and their average meaningful. The output base is deleted when the tool finishes.

For every repeat the tool:

1. runs `bazel build <target> --memory_profile=<tmp> --memory_profile_stable_heap_parameters=4,4`,
2. parses the retained heap of the *Load and analyze dependencies* phase from the memory profile
   (`analysis_heap_used`, `analysis_heap_committed`, in MB), and
3. reads `bazel info gc-count gc-time max-heap-size peak-heap-size used-heap-size used-heap-size-after-gc`.

`--memory_profile_stable_heap_parameters=4,4` forces 4 full GCs (4s apart) before each phase's
heap is recorded, so `analysis_heap_used` reflects the retained live set after analysis - a
stable, comparable number rather than a noisy point-in-time snapshot. This is the headline metric
for the aspect's memory overhead.

Pass `--nobuild` to stop after analysis, so the numbers reflect only the phase where the aspect does
its work, which is recorded in the report's `nobuild` field. By default the actions are executed too.
Note that bazel then fuses analysis and execution into a single
*Load, analyze dependencies and build artifacts* phase, so the heap numbers of a full build cover
execution as well and are not comparable with the analysis-only ones.

## The report

The report is a textproto with one `metrics` entry per metric, holding the baseline and the
aspect-enabled run side by side:

```textproto
metrics {
  name: "analysis_heap_used"
  baseline {
    values: 2081.2
    values: 2094.7
    values: 2094.4
    avg: 2090.1
    std: 7.71
  }
  aspect {
    values: 2470.1
    values: 2488.3
    values: 2485.5
    avg: 2481.3
    std: 9.80
  }
  cmp: 18.72
}
```

`values` are the raw per-repeat readings in run order, `avg` is their arithmetic mean and `std`
their sample standard deviation (n-1). `cmp` is the percentage the aspect average adds over the
baseline average.

Read `cmp` together with both deviations: a comparison smaller than the runs' own spread is noise,
not overhead. A statistic that is undefined - `std` of a single repeat, `cmp` against a zero
baseline - is zero, and therefore omitted from the textproto. The baseline run is always measured.

## Manual use

```
bazel run //tools/measure -- <project> -l java,kotlin -r 3
```

`<project>` is a Bazel workspace directory. Its contents are linked into a temporary workspace and
measured with a separate server (own output roots, no system or home rc files, minimal environment).
The project's `.bazelrc` is read. Build actions run on the host with `--spawn_strategy=local`.

To reuse repository downloads between invocations, pass a cache directory explicitly:

```sh
bazel run //tools/measure -- <project> -l java,kotlin -r 3 --repo_cache ~/.cache/intellij-aspect-repo
```

The tool uses the pinned local BCR snapshot from `@bcr_archive`, also used by the test fixtures.
Registry metadata is extracted before warmup and resolved locally; module source archives and
toolchains still need network access on cache misses. Update `bazel_registry.bcr` in `MODULE.bazel`
if a project needs module versions newer than the snapshot. The repository cache stores downloads,
not build outputs, so sharing it preserves the cold analysis measurements.

## Bazel rule

`heap_analysis` from `//testing/rules:defs.bzl` runs the tool as a build action against a project
downloaded by the `bazel_registry.project` module extension tag and produces the report as a
textproto file. The project archive is extracted once by a separate, cacheable action; only the
measurement itself re-runs every time.

```python
bazel_registry.project(
    name = "intellij_community",
    tag = "idea/2026.2.2",
    sha256 = "...",
    url = "https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community",
)
```

```python
load("//testing/rules:defs.bzl", "heap_analysis")

heap_analysis(
    name = "intellij",
    bazel_version = "9.2.0",
    languages = [
        "java",
        "kotlin",
    ],
    project = "@intellij_community//:project.zip",
)
```

`bazel_version` and `languages` are mandatory, everything else has a default: `target` is `//...`,
`repeats` is 3 and `nobuild` is off, so the measurement covers analysis and execution. Set
`nobuild = True` for an analysis-only report.

```
bazel build //testing/tests/perf:intellij
cat bazel-bin/testing/tests/perf/intellij.textproto
```

The measurement action runs locally without Bazel sandboxing, is never cached, and always
re-measures. Project extraction remains a separate cacheable action.

Configure the repository cache with the existing test-infrastructure flag, either on the command
line or in the git-ignored `user.bazelrc`:

```text
build --//testing/rules:repo_cache=~/.cache/intellij-aspect-repo
```

The directory is created if needed; `~` is expanded and relative paths are resolved against the
measurement process's working directory. Prefer an absolute path or `~/` in `user.bazelrc`.
An unset flag leaves Bazel's default cache under the temporary output root, so downloads are not
preserved between benchmark invocations.

CI passes `bazel info repository_cache` to the same flag, sharing the repository cache restored
and saved by `setup-bazel` with the nested benchmark builds.

Benchmark targets should be tagged `manual`, so
a wildcard build never picks up a multi-minute benchmark, and `exclusive`, so no two of them
compete for the machine and skew each other's numbers.
